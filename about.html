    <h3>Sporting Clay Shooting</h3>
    <p>Sporting Clay Shooting is one of our club's primary disciplines. It's a challenging and dynamic form of shooting that simulates the unpredictability of bird hunting. Shooters move through a course, engaging various clay targets launched at different angles and speeds. It's a thrilling experience that tests accuracy, reflexes, and adaptability.</p>

    <p>Our club specializes in a range of clay shooting disciplines to cater to diverse interests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Down The Line (DTL):</strong> A classic clay shooting discipline where targets are launched away from the shooter in a straight line.</li>
        <li><strong>Skeet Shooting:</strong> In this discipline, targets are launched from two houses in a variety of angles, challenging the shooter's ability to quickly adapt.</li>
        <li><strong>Trap Shooting:</strong> A discipline that involves targets launched from a single "trap" machine, providing a variety of shot trajectories.</li>
